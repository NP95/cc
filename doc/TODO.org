* MOESI
** L2
- Remove "Table look". All context should be in the context object,
  not in the interpreter itself.
- L1GetS from O; add notion of sharer state to L2 directory.
- Context should be extended to contain the L1Cache from which a
  command origited.
- NextEpoch only not WaitOr (simply the logic).
** CC
- Remove notion of "State" only transient states; CC does not
  understand cache lines only transaction which are currently in
  flight.
** General
- Rationalize notion of transient states.
